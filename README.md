There is a significant issue that ambulances, patients, or their families often face: an ambulance might take a patient to a hospital only to find out that the hospital is full, forcing them to transport the patient to another hospital, wasting precious time.

Another problem is that a patient or their family might rush to the nearest hospital without knowing if the hospital can treat the patient's condition or if there is available space.

A third issue is that a patient might go to a well-known hospital assuming it can treat their condition, without realizing that there are other nearby hospitals that could also provide the necessary care.

Our application addresses all these problems. It allows the user to input the patient's condition and select the type of hospital they prefer (public, private, or both). The user then inputs their current location and requests a search. The application will provide three nearby hospitals that have available space and can treat the condition, based on the userâ€™s preference for a public or private hospital.

This solution saves time for the user, the patient, their assistant, or the paramedic using the application.
